# Experiment on the Clustering algorithm 

**This folder contains the code to run our experiment on the clustering algorithm.**

For the submission at VLDB 2025 of

*On the Adverse Effect of Suppression in Differential Privacy*
by Ã€lex Miranda-Pascual, Javier Parra-Arnau and Thorsten Strufe

## Overview 

The code generates the CSV files and plots of the utility results used in the paper. The experiment in this folder covers our mean computation over numerical bases for the DPLloyd algorithm.  

For a given database and column, the code runs the NoisyAverage algorithm for the specified epsilons and delta. It generates all the CSV files and plots altogether. 

The code is written in Python 3.8.20.

## Installation

Requirements can be installed with the following:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

To run the code, create and run a `.py` file with the following command:

```bash
from principal_function import *

generateFileandGraph(database_name="adult_clustering.csv", columns=["age", "fnlwgt", "education-num", "capital-gain", "capital-loss", "hours-per-week"], main_folder_name="Adult_clustering", number_clusters=5, range_columns=[[0,125],[0,2227058],[1,16],[0,149999],[0,6534],[0,100]], normalized_range_value=1, list_epsilons=[0.25,0.5,1,2])

generateFileandGraph(database_name="adult_train.csv", column_name="age", main_folder_name="Adult", value_range=[0,125], list_epsilons=[0.25,0.5,1,2])
```

The `generateFileandGraph` function generates all the CSV files and plots for the specified database. The inputs of this function are the following:

* `database_name`: Path of the tested database (a CSV file with labeled rows and no indices).
* `columns`: List of the columns name of the tested database (each in `str' format).
* `main_folder_name`: Name of the main folder where the CSV files and plots will be stored (in `str' format). 
* `range_columns`: List of the range of values for the sensitivity using in the mechanism. Each term in the list must be introduced as pair containing the lower and upper numerical values, i.e., `[0,125]`. It must have the same size as the list in `columns` and the ranges must correspond to the column respecting the order. 
* `number_clusters`: Number of clusters for the clustering algorithm. 
* `normalized_range_value`: Integer necessary to normalize every column. The default parameter is set to `1`. 
* `list_epsilons`: List of epsilon values the experiment runs for. It must be introduced as a list of numerical values, all larger than 0. The default parameter is set to `[0.25,0.5,1,2]`. 

## Output

The output CSV files and plots are all included in the directory: `main_folder_name`. Inside this directory, the `CSVfiles` and `Plots` folder contains, respectively, the CSV files and plots. Also included in this directory is:

* `[database_name]_normalized.csv`: The CSV file containing the normalized database so each value is between -`normalized_range_value` and `normalized_range_value`, as required by DPLloyd.
* `[all names in the [columns] list]distance.csv`: The CSV file containing the average distance of every record in the database to the others, used to generate the outlier scores.

Inside the `CSVfiles` and `Plots` folders, a subfolder with the name created from concatenating the strings in `columns` is created. The CSV files in `CSVfiles`/ `[all names in the [columns] list]` are:

* Files of the type `eps=[epsilon]_[mechanism].csv` containing the normalized intracluster variance (NICV) of DPLloyd for every of the `500` iterations. A missing number appearing in the CSV file means that the mechanism could not be run for the given epsilon and delta parameters. One file is generated for every `epsilon` in `list_epsilons`, and there are four `mechanism` runs:
** `M`: mechanism NoisyAverage (M) without suppression run for the given epsilon and delta.
** `MoS`: mechanism NoisyAverage (M) with suppression S run for the given epsilon and delta.
** `M_ChangeEpsDelta`: mechanism NoisyAverage (M) without suppression run for the epsilon and delta that ensures that M and MoS have the same privacy parameters.  
** `MoS_ChangeEpsDelta`: mechanism NoisyAverage (M) with suppression S run for the epsilon and delta that ensures that M and MoS have the same privacy parameters.
* Files of the type `eps=[epsilon]_[mechanism]_[mechanism]_Average.csv`, where the empirical mean over the numerical values of `500` iterations is computed for every `(m,M)`.
* Files of the type `eps=[epsilon]_[mechanism]_[mechanism]_Variance.csv`, where the empirical variance over the numerical values of `500` iterations is computed for every `(m,M)`.
* Files of the type `eps=[epsilon]_[mechanism]_combined_[Average/Variance].csv` containing the absolute error differences of M - MoS, M - MoSChangeEpsDelta and MChangeEpsDelta - MoS for every `(m,M)`. These are used in the plot creation. 

The Plots in `Plots`/`[column_name]` are:

* Files of the type `eps=[epsilon]_difference_error_[mechanism_difference]_[statistic]_10--90.pdf`: For each `epsilon` and the `delta` value, a plot with the utility difference is given over different values of `(m,M)`. The variations are:
** `noise` is either `laplace` or `gaussian`, depending on the noise added. 
** `mechanism_difference` is either `M_minus_MoS`, `M_minus_MoSChangeEpsDelta` or `MChangeEpsDelta_minus_MoS`, depending on which of the three differences is plotted.
** `statistic` is either `Averege`, the average of the NICV, or `Variance`, the variance of the NICV. 
* `[all names in the [columns] list]_uniform_Poisson_sampling_[statistic].pdf`: The plots showing the effect of uniform Poisson sampling. The condition `statistic` is as before. 

## Results for Paper and Time to Run

The file `main.py` contains the experiment we ran for the mean computation. The time to run is dependent on the size of the database. In our case, each experiment on the `adult_train` database took around 3 days. The code contains a parallelization into 64 pools.
